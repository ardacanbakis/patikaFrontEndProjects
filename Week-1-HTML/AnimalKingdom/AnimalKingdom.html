    <h1>Animal Kingdom</h1>
    <p>The diversity of animals on Earth is incredibly vast, spanning across a wide range of habitats. From the depths of the oceans to the mysterious corners of tropical forests, and the icy landscapes of polar ice caps, each habitat has been home to different species. Animals exhibit great diversity in their sizes, shapes, colors, and behaviors. Among vertebrates, there are birds, fish, reptiles, amphibians, and mammals, while among invertebrates, there are groups such as insects, mollusks, and marine invertebrates. Each species fulfills a specific role in the ecosystem, and this diversity maintains the biological balance of our planet.</p>
